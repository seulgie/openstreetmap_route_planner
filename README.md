# OpenStreetMap Route Planner

This repo contains a C++ project that implements a **route planning application** using real map data from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). 
This application reads map data, calculates the shortest path between two points 
using the **A* search algorithm**, and visually renders the route on a 2D map using the
**IO2D graphics library**.
This project demonstrates:
- C++ practice: including classes, pointers, references, and STL containers.
- Algorithm implementation: A* pathfinding with heuristics.
- Practical application: Working with real-world map data (OpenStreetMap).
- Unit testing: Ensuring correctness with Google Test.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world route planning system, 
similar to the functionality found in mapping applications like Google Maps.
This project focuses on:

- Parsing **OpenStreetMap XML (.osm) data**.
- Building a **graph model** of nodes and edges (RouteModel).
- Implementing the **A* search algorithm** to find the shortest path.
- Rendering the map and the calculated route with **IO2D**.

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
